It breaks my heart 'cause I know you're the one for me
Don't you feel sad there never was a story, obviously
To never be

And you will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you, no
You will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you

With every smile comes my reality, irony
You won't find out what has been killing me
Can't you see me?
Can't you see?

And you will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you no
And you will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you no, no
You will never know
I will never show
What I feel, what I need from you
